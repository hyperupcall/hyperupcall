Red Pandas! This guy be climbing trees _and_ writing code!

Recently, I've been working on:

- A PKM (personal knowledge management) system called [Quasipanacea](https://github.com/quasipanacea)
- A Bash package manager called [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt)
  - [bash-object](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-object), a _Bash library_ for managing heterogenous data hierarchies
  - [bash-json](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-json), a _Bash library_ for parsing JSON
  - [bash-term](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-term), a _Bash library_ for terminal escape sequences
  - [Bake](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bake), a Bash-based make alternative
- [Woof](https://github.com/version-manager/woof), a language agnostic version manager (written in Bash)

Most of my code lives in separate GitHub organizations. Major ones include:

- [quasipanacea](https://github.com/quasipanacea) holds my personal knowledge management system
- [bash-bastion](https://github.com/bash-bastion) holds all my Bash projects
- [version-manager](https://github.com/version-manager) holds my personal tool/language version manager and associated plugins
- [fox-land](https://github.com/fox-land) holds my personal extensions and configuration presets for various tools
- [fox-templates](https://github.com/fox-templates) holds my project templates
- [fox-archives](https://github.com/fox-archives) holds ~100 projects that I have archived over the years
- [fox-forks](https://github.com/fox-forks) holds my forks of external repositories

I also like contributing to open source! Some contributions include:
