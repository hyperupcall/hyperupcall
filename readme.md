Red Pandas! This guy be climbing trees _and_ writing code!

Recently, I've been working on:

- A PKM (personal knowledge management) system called [Quasipanacea](https://github.com/quasipanacea)
- A Bash package manager called [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt)
  - [bash-object](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-object), a _Bash library_ for managing heterogenous data hierarchies
  - [bash-json](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-json), a _Bash library_ for parsing JSON
  - [bash-term](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-term), a _Bash library_ for terminal escape sequences
  - [Bake](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bake), a Bash-based make alternative
- [Woof](https://github.com/version-manager/woof), a language agnostic version manager (written in Bash)

Most of my code lives in external organizations. Major ones include:

- [quasipanacea](https://github.com/quasipanacea) is a personal knowledge management system
- [bash-bastion](https://github.com/bash-bastion) holds all my public Bash projects
- [version-manager](https://github.com/version-manager) contains projects and plugins for my personal tool/language version manager
- [fox-land](https://github.com/fox-land) has repositories for tool configuration 
- [fox-templates](https://github.com/fox-templates) holds my project templates
- [fox-archives](https://github.com/fox-archives) contains ~100 projects that I have archived over the years
- [fox-forks](https://github.com/fox-forks) has all my forks of external projects

I also like contributing to open source! Some contributions include:

- 56+ [contributions](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pulls?q=author%3Ahyperupcall+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to [SchemaStore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore), a collection of JSON schemas for widely-used programs
- 49+ [contributions](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/pulls?q=author%3Ahyperupcall+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), an extendable, multi-language version manager
- 25+ [contributions](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/pulls?q=author%3Ahyperupcall+is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to [xournalpp](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp), a stylus-based, note-taking application written with C++ and GTK3
