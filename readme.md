Red Pandas! This guy be climbing trees _and_ writing code!

About me, I mostly program in Bash and Go. Recently, I've been working on:

- A Bash package manager called [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt)
  - [bash-object](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-object), a _Bash library_ for managing heterogenous data hierarchies
  - [bash-json](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-json), a _Bash library_ for parsing JSON
  - [bash-term](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-term), a _Bash library_ for terminal escape sequences
  - [Bake](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bake), a Bash-based make alternative
  - [Hookah](https://github.com/hyperupcall/hookah), an elegantly minimal Git hooks solution written in Bash
- [Woof](https://github.com/hyperupcall/woof), a language agnostic version manager (written in Bash)
- [redpanda](https://github.com/hyperupcall/redpanda), a tool for cross-repository refactoring
