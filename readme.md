- [ten](https://github.com/fox-incubating/ten), a personal static site generator
- [dev](https://github.com/fox-incubating/dev), a personal tool for streamlining development tasks

- A Bash package manager called [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt)
  - [bash-object](https://github.com/bash-bastion/bash-object), a _Bash library_ for managing heterogenous data hierarchies
