Red Pandas! This guy be climbing trees _and_ writing code!

About me, I mostly program in Bash and Go. Recently, I've been working on

- A Bash package manager called [Basalt](https:/github.com/hyperupcall/basalt)
- A language agnostic version manager called [Woof](https:/github.com/hyperupcall/woof)

Check out my projects if you wish, and thankies for visiting my profile! ^_^
